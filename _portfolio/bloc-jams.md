# Bloc Jams Case Study

### Summary

Bloc Jams is a music player similar to Spotify that allows users to have access to their favorite music wherever they are.

### Explanation

This project was built using JavaScript and its jQuery library.

I started the project by setting up a basic HTML structure for the application.  From there, CSS was added to style the page and make it responsive to any laptop or mobile device from which the user will be accessing the application.  Adding collection and album view pages to the application expanded it further so users are able to have their own personal collection of music available to them.  Play and pause buttons were added along with a seek bar so users can have control over their music selections.  DOM scripting was used to make the application was able to interact with the browser, therefore, making it more responsive.

jQuery was then introduced into the application in place of some of the DOM scripting to simplify the development of Bloc Jams.  Refactoring the application with jQuery on, for example, the album view page, made the code less bloated.  Mp3’s and jQuery’s Buzz library were introduced into the application to make it an active music player instead of a silent one.  Bloc Jams functions the same as it did with vanilla JavaScript, only now with simplified tasks jQuery provides.

### Conclusion

Building out Bloc Jams as my first application was not without issues considering this was my very first frontend development project.  With patience and repetition, I gained more of an understanding of the ideas being introduced to me and what parts they play in building out a clean and responsive application.
