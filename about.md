Hello! My name is Kenya. I am a web developer born and raised in the Chicago suburbs. 

My journey to becoming a web developer was definitely not a straight line.  Web development wasn't even on my radar a few years ago. I attended college and received my Bachelors' degree in Business Administration and Marketing. After working in the banking industry for almost 6 years, I moved into the managed care arena. During my time in that industry, I also went back to school and received my MBA in Health Administration and Human Resource Management. Just recently, web development came onto my radar. I wanted something that would challenge me on a daily basis. I started with some online tutorials and found out soon I was hooked. For a deeper dive into my journey into web development, please visit my blog posts!

In addition to web development, I am something of an entertainment nerd/junkie. I enjoy movies, television and watching my Chicago Bulls play! Win or lose, I'm with them all the way! I also enjoy live concerts, travelling and spending time with my family and friends. As much as I love travelling, I have never been out of the continental United States. My two dream vacations would be an African safari in Kenya and a tropical vacation to Bora Bora. 

I love learning and finding out how things work, which is part of what lead me to choose web development as a career. I am looking forward to this continued journey in development and I hope to collaborate with you in the future!
